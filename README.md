**Title
Quote Generator - Codecademy Challenge

**Purpose
Every time a user runs the program, they should get a new, random message output.   

**Description
I took inspiration from Sophanarith Sok Freecodecamp's Epiphany clock and modified it.

-I removed the javascript function for the Time format to read as a 24 hour clock
-I changed the background image url link
-I modified the responsiveness media query code
-HTML & CSS properties were modified to remove footer links and icons
-I modified the button CSS 
-I changed the quotes in the Javascript array

**Getting Started
You will need a code editor (I use VS code) to be able to access the html, css and Javascript files.

**Installing
You can install on your local drive and open the html file to launch the program in your local browser.
